                <p>AC/DC is an iconic Australian rock band formed in Sydney in 1973. Known for their high-energy performances and electrifying guitar riffs, the band has become a major influence in the rock genre. AC/DC's classic lineup features Angus Young on lead guitar and his distinctive schoolboy outfit, while his brother Malcolm Young played rhythm guitar until his retirement due to health issues. The band's hard-hitting sound and timeless hits, such as "Highway to Hell," "Back in Black," and "Thunderstruck," have earned them a global fanbase and cemented their status as one of the greatest rock bands of all time. Despite various lineup changes over the years, AC/DC continues to captivate audiences with their powerful music and enduring legacy.</p>
